### Cleanup branch (chore/repo-cleanup) — pending merge

The cleanup branch (commits `11bad46` → `fdcd4b0`) closes 13 of 14
Critical findings from the §1 12-agent codebase audit and resolves 33 of
36 Supabase advisor findings. See its commit history for the full list.
Highlights:

- **Supabase RLS cleanup.** Enable RLS + add policies on 26 unprotected
  public tables (whales, copy_trades, naka_trust_scores, smart money,
  bubblemap, etc.). Rebuild `pending_trades_active` view with
  `security_invoker = true`. Lock `set_updated_at` search_path. Revoke
  `EXECUTE` on `handle_new_user*` from anon/authenticated. Replace
  always-true policies on `engagement` and `waitlist`. Add `is_admin()`
  helper. Advisor goes 36 → 3.
- **API auth gaps closed.** Hardcoded admin password removed from
  `app/api/builder-submissions`. Auth added to `admin/coingecko-usage`.
  Mass-assignment fixed in `admin/featured-tokens`. Webhook signature
  verification fail-closes in production for both Alchemy and Helius
  (Helius now uses `crypto.timingSafeEqual`).
- **Sniper auth.** `app/api/sniper/execute` wraps in `withTierGate('pro')`
  and derives `user.id` from session, closing the cross-user
  execution-history pollution vector.
- **Address normalization.** Add `lib/utils/addressNormalize.ts` and
  route 6 known `.toLowerCase()` callsites through it (zerox,
  autoConnect, pendingSigner, goplusService, Cluster2DGraph,
  WhaleAvatar). Solana case-sensitivity bugs closed.
- **VTX prompt injection.** Allow-list `personality`, `language`,
  `riskAppetite`, `depth` before they touch the system prompt. Cap
  history length at 100 before slicing (DoS guard).
- **Auth tokens.** Drop deterministic-HMAC scheme in `lib/authTokens.ts`.
  Add `auth_tokens` table with random 32-byte tokens stored as SHA-256
  hashes, 30-min TTL for reset / 24-hour for verify, atomic single-use
  consume.
- **Admin server-side gate.** `middleware.ts` now verifies
  `profiles.role = 'admin'` before any `/admin/*` page renders.
- **Wallet hardening.** Remove broken XOR decryption fallback (3
  callsites). `walletSession.ts` rewritten with closure-private state,
  30-min sliding TTL, `pagehide` + `visibilitychange` clear.
- **Anthropic cache.** Remove `as Anthropic.Tool` cast on
  `tagToolsForCache` — current SDK supports `cache_control` natively.

Documentation added during the round:
- `CLAUDE.md` (project rules for Claude Code sessions)
- `SECURITY.md` (vulnerability disclosure policy)
- `.env.example` (full env-var reference)
- `TECHNICAL_DEBT.md` (deferred Medium / Low audit findings)
- `SECURITY_BACKLOG.md` (deferred Critical / High requiring owner action)
- `docs/cleanup-2026-05/audit-findings.md` (12-agent §1 audit verbatim)
- `docs/cleanup-2026-05/supabase-cleanup-log.md` (per-issue advisor table)

## Pre-2026-05-02

History before this changelog was started lives in `git log`. The
session-handoff documents in `docs/sessions/` summarize the major
phases:

- `HANDOFF-session-A.md` — initial platform build
- `HANDOFF-session-B.md` — security pass + 14-rule hardening
- `HANDOFF-session-C.md` — native charts, AppKit + SecurityGate, 6 live
  migrations, 10-agent audit
